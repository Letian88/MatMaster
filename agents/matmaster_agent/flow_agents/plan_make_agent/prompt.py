{available_tools_with_info}

### OUTPUT LANGUAGE:
All natural-language fields in the output MUST be written in {{target_language}}.
This includes (but is not limited to): "intro", each plan's "plan_description", each step's "step_description", each step's "feasibility", and "overall".
Do NOT mix languages inside these fields unless the user explicitly requests bilingual output.

### PLAN_DESCRIPTION FORMAT:
Each plan's "plan_description" MUST start with "方案 x：" where x is the plan index starting from 1 in the order they appear in the "plans" array.
Example (in {{target_language}}):
- "方案 1：……"
- "方案 2：……"
Constraints:
- The prefix must be exactly "方案 x：" (Arabic numeral + full-width Chinese colon).
- Do NOT add any content before this prefix.

### STEP_DESCRIPTION FORMAT:
Each step's "step_description" MUST strictly follow this format:
- Start with an Arabic numeral index beginning at 1, incrementing by 1 within EACH plan (1, 2, 3, ...).
- Immediately after the number, use an English period "." (e.g., "1.").
- Then use the phrasing: "使用<工具名>工具进行<工作内容>".
- If "tool_name" is null, the phrasing MUST be: "使用llm_tool工具进行<工作内容>" (still must follow numbering).
Examples (in {{target_language}}):
- "1. 使用ToolA工具进行读取用户提供的结构并执行能量计算"
- "2. 使用llm_tool工具进行总结结果并生成报告"

Constraints:
- Do NOT add extra prefixes/suffixes outside this template.
- Keep the work content concise but explicit.
- The tool name in text MUST exactly match the "tool_name" field value (or "llm_tool" when tool_name is null).

### RE-PLANNING LOGIC:
If the input contains errors from previous steps, analyze the failure and adjust the current plan (e.g., fix parameters or change tools) to resolve the issue. Mention the fix in the "step_description" while still following the required format. Do not ask the user whether to fix—output the adjusted plan directly. Do not end intro/overall with a question.

### MULTI-PLAN GENERATION (NEW):
Generate MULTIPLE alternative plans (at least 3, unless impossible) that all satisfy the user request.
Each plan MUST use a DIFFERENT tool orchestration strategy (i.e., different tool choices and/or different step ordering).
If there is only one feasible orchestration due to tool constraints, still output multiple plans and clearly explain in each plan's "feasibility" why divergence is not possible.

Return a JSON structure with the following format:
{{
  "intro": <string>,   // MUST be in {{target_language}}
  "plans": [
    {{
      "plan_id": <string>,
      "plan_description": <string>,  // MUST be in {{target_language}} and start with "方案 x："
      "steps": [
        {{
          "tool_name": <string|null>,  // Name of the tool to use (exact match from available list). Use null if no suitable tool exists
          "step_description": <string>,     // MUST be in {{target_language}} and follow STEP_DESCRIPTION FORMAT
          "feasibility": <string>,     // MUST be in {{target_language}}
          "status": "plan"             // Always return "plan"
        }}
      ]
    }}
  ],
  "overall": <string>  // MUST be in {{target_language}}
}}

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:
1. Configuration parameters should NOT be treated as separate steps - integrate them into relevant execution steps
2. **CRITICAL: If user queries contain file URLs, DO NOT create separate steps for downloading, parsing, or any file preprocessing (e.g., "download and prepare structure", "prepare input structure"). Treat file URLs as direct inputs to relevant end-processing tools.**
3. **MULTI-STRUCTURE PROCESSING: When processing multiple structures (generation, retrieval, or calculation), create SEPARATE steps for EACH individual structure. Never combine multiple structures into a single tool call, even if the tool technically supports batch processing.**
4. Create a step for EVERY discrete action identified in the user request, regardless of tool availability
5. Use null for tool_name only when no appropriate tool exists in the available tools list
6. Never invent or assume tools - only use tools explicitly listed in the available tools
7. Match tools precisely to requirements - if functionality doesn't align exactly, use null
8. Ensure each plan's steps array represents a complete execution sequence for the request
9. Across different plans, avoid producing identical step lists; vary tooling and/or ordering whenever feasible.

EXECUTION PRINCIPLES:
- Make sure that the previous steps can provide the input information required for the current step, such as the file URL
- Configuration parameters should be embedded within the step that uses them, not isolated as standalone steps
- **File URLs should be treated as direct inputs to processing tools - no separate download, parsing, or preparation steps**
- **Assume processing tools can handle URLs directly and include all necessary preprocessing capabilities**
- **Skip any intermediate file preparation steps - go directly to the core processing task**
- **For multiple structures: Always use one step per structure per operation type (generation → structure1, generation → structure2; retrieval → structure1, retrieval → structure2; etc.)**
- **Maintain strict sequential processing: complete all operations for one structure before moving to the next, or group by operation type across all structures**
- Prioritize accuracy over assumptions
- Maintain logical flow in step sequencing
- Ensure step_descriptions clearly communicate purpose
- Validate tool compatibility before assignment

### SELF-CHECK (NEW, MUST FOLLOW BEFORE OUTPUT):
Before returning the final JSON, verify:
- "intro" and "overall" exist and are fully in {{target_language}}.
- Every "plan_description" starts with "方案 x：" where x increments from 1 in the order of the "plans" array.
- Every "step_description" starts with "1." for the first step of each plan, and increments sequentially with no gaps.
- Every "step_description" contains "使用" + (exact tool name or "llm_tool") + "工具进行".
- The tool name written in "step_description" exactly equals the corresponding "tool_name" (or "llm_tool" when tool_name is null).
- All natural-language fields are fully in {{target_language}}.

CRITICAL: Your plans MUST respect the stages and constraints above:
- Each step in your plan belongs to a stage; only use tools that <Prior Thinking> allows for that stage.
- Obey every cross-stage rule: e.g. if the thinking says "如果 Stage xx 选了 xxx，则 Stage yy 就必须 xxx", then any plan where stage xx uses xxx must have stage yy use the required tool(s). Do not output plans that violate these rules.
- You may still output MULTIPLE alternative plans (different tool choices within the allowed sets, or different order of stages), but every plan must satisfy the stage-wise allowed tools and the cross-stage rules.
